          <h1>About us of Mulata Hayu Academy</h1>
          <p>Mul’ata Hayu Educational Institute is a corporate entity registered as a private limited company under business proclamation No. of the Ethiopian Commercial Code. Established in 2011 by over a dozen of dedicated professional teachers as shareholders, the institute has since been operating with the mission to provide education, training and research, and consultancy services. Regarding institutional progress, overall the institute has undergone a laudable growth and expansion in its operation. The institute first established by 14 shareholders, it has since increased the number of shareholders to 19. With regard to business operations, to date, the institute has been providing kindergarten and primary education at Mul’ata Hayu Academy, an academy that has been in full operation till now. Dedicated to providing quality education, the institute’s schools under the umbrella of Mul’ata Hayu Academy have experienced growth in student enrollments across both KG and Grade levels since its establishment. It started with 6 staff and 30 students in a small school Premise. The academy now runs seven large school premises staffed with over more than a hundred well qualified teaching and administrative personnel and boasts students under its care. However, education is yet only one of the three business ventures the institute was established to undertake. And hence, although education is still expected to remain the major focus area of the institute's operations for the years to come, it is also in the interest of the shareholders to diversify the institute’s service offers by venturing into the other service sectors, namely: training and consultancy services. Hence, the institute found it imperative to prepare a new strategic plan to further boost its institutional growth in terms of both expansion and diversification, to keep abreast of new developments, and meet new demands from its customers.
